# Who am I?
I'm a aeronautical/astronautical Engineering students currently on the final year of reaching my degree. <br>
I currently in a mastery (trying to) Aerodynamics studies and developing much intrest in automation of engineering problem through programming. <br>
Born in 1999, initially wanted to take computer science master degree in Jakarta, Indonesia. I guess with the further intrest of programming, i can take it again as my goal.<br>
Enrolling in Aeronautical Engineering program at Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia at 2017. Lucky enough to be accepted (as my name would suggest, okay thats a bad pun). <br>
Currently doing final year by finishing up courses i did fail or have not being taken with addition of Final Undergraduate thesis. <br>
The undergraduate thesis will have a machine learning algorithm for optimizations of something (its a secret, for now atleast).<br>
This will be done with phyton language and i still have no idea about phyton. <br>

# What do i do?
I do MATLAB computational programming with further intrest in java, phyton, and html.<br>

# How did i develop interest in Programming? 
Started with one course of Engineering Analysis and Numerical method at my major (liked it so much i take it twice, no jk). <br>
Apparently this course use a lot of MATLAB for the plotting and calculations, that for me is a major setback as initially i get overwhelmed by the word "Coding". <br>
Initially, just doing the work based on the problem presented by the lecturers. Then got confused, then looking at my friends code and somewhat able to understand it. <br>
While understanding the code i think to myself "Why you make a program with one fixed input with a maximum of one difference?". 
That got me thinking again "If everything can be coded by a program, why would we bother with analytical calculations". At that time i made a lot of simple calculation mistakes. <br>
Now, i have a motto/principle. <br>
    <p align="center"><em>**"If you make a program, don't create it with only one input and one variation as it will be useless in terms of actual usage."**<em></p>
